/**
 * Application table types for Kysely.
 *
 * These describe the *app-owned* tables only. Better Auth owns and migrates its
 * own tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`) via its adapter; we
 * do not model those here in M0. When we need to join against them (M1+), the
 * generated types from `kysely-codegen` (`types.generated.ts`) provide the full
 * picture across both migration owners.
